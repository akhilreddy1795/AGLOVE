You know When did I realised I needed someone like you in my life? It's the Pangong Lake where we're playing with stones, and a car passing by was smiling as it saw us enjoying those little moments. At that wonderful time, I looked at you and stared for a while, thinking FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN MY LIFE TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU IN MY LIFE.

And you know that wonderful night where miracles happened? I was in disbelief on what was happening, a little stunned and hesitant to make a decision, and the very next day in Delhi we were close all day catching hands together, you have no idea how happy I was that entire day. Next, we boarded the flight, and I secretly hoped to have you by my side on the flight, which didn't happened, then we landed and posed for one last selfie, and having left apart, I already felt something was missing me, and on the bus ride home, I missed your presence more than I could bear, and I knew all I need was you by my side. Thinking we liked each other for being ourselves during the entire trip and the care you took and the fact that you are selfless like meÂ made me to approach you, In this age of profit and loss relationships, I feel that ours is a genuine connection that brings all my love to you sweetheart.
