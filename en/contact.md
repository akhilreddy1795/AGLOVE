**From now on, my dream is your dream, and your dream is mine, and we share equal responsibility for achieving our goals and living this amazing life to the fullest.**

# My Dear Future Kids:

MY DEAR FUTURE SON/DAUGHTER, you will witness your mother and father becoming old togetherÂ and loving each other; if you ever discover anybody who loves the way your mother and father love each other, don't take them for granted; you should trust them completely until they lose it. Remember, once trust is destroyed in any relationship, there is no future. Your father never broke your mother's trust, and my lady, your mother never, ever broke mine. We lived in our own strange world, and there are many stories for you to hear. as well as much more in the making. With Love MOMDAD.

# SURPRISE:

By the time you read this, I may have prepared to launch a rocket into the sky and shout loudly, **"I LOVE YOU GAUTHAMI!"**
