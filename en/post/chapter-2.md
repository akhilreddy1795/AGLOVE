---

All my life, I have always been on the giving side, never been on the receiving end. For the first time in my life, I received a present from someone other than my family and it was from you. That day, I just wanted to give you everything I had. I never had that feeling before, and it made me feel so glad about how much I meant to you.

Those two tee shirts and flowers you preserved will be with me for the rest of my life.

I remember the day we went to purchase a dress for my sister's birthday, and when you put it on in the trial room and came out, my heart just fell seeing you so beautiful and thinking how lucky I am, at that instance I knew I am taking that dress for you not to my sister.

### My First Food Order

You know I sometimes surprise you by ordering food, and I also surprise a few of my friends by ordering something random knowing their scenario, I never received anything in return from anyone, and I was simply delighted to bring joy to others, for the first time ever I received a food order from you, which was cream stone ice cream, was the first time I felt loved back. You have no idea how much that order meant to me. I still hold that ice cream cup you ordered that day because it seems so precious to me.

##### **I enjoy remembering all the tiny things you do for me, and I wish to  have many more moments with you for the rest of my life.**
