## Mom & Dad Marriage Anniversary:

We were travelling back from Srisailam to warangal on our parents' anniversary, we planned to stop for lunch in Hyderabad,As you recall, I invited you to join us for lunch at the same restaurant. Unfortunately, you must travel with your family, and I understand how sad you felt for not being there that day, despite the fact that you made your presence known by surprising me with a cake on my table. I just left spellbound for a moment to answer my parents' question about who sent the cake, and my inner voice tells me to say it's your daughter-in-law,Â my wife sent you this present. and replied that a friend sent me this to surprise you, **That's when I fell in love with you again, My Love.**

## Your Good Morning Messages:

You know what I do first thing in the morning? I grab my phone and check for your Good Morning message, which you have never missed until today. When I didn't get your message by the time I woke up, I started sending you that just to hear from you as soon as possible. I've never waited for a response from someone before, and waiting for your messages made me realise how much you've already become a part of me, and I can't picture a day starting without your message. **I love you to the moon and back, darling.**
