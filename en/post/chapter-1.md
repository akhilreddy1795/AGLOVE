I had no idea how this date thing works, and with the image I carry, there was
no way for me to contact any friends, then Google came to my rescue. since I didn't
want to go empty-handed, I quickly went and collected the bunch of roses and
already had my Amazon purchase delivered the previous night, all I need is to
start my journey at 4 in the morning.

I still remember how I felt that day, when I was meeting **GAUTHAMI** for the
first time on a date. Excited from head to toe, wondering how to act and what to
say, unsure how to communicate on how much I like you.

## My First Letter

With all of my excitement, I began my journey in the morning, and I was unsure if I will ever express my feelings for you, so I thought the best possible way to communicate would be through letter, which is what I felt and wrote my first ever letter to you

##### IT QUOTES:
---
* **I might not be your first love, but I could be the last one.**
* Hello, Gauthami. Have you ever been told that you have the most **beautiful eyes I've ever seen**, and I wish all of my High school lads were here to see who I'm going out with and feel jealous of it.

## The Beginning

After going through all of that, I finally saw you, and I vividly remember the scene. When you entered my car, I was happy to see you, and I gently grabbed the flowers from the back seat and handed them to you. And I can still see the emotion in your eyes after holding that bouquet; my heart was overjoyed and I wanted to hug you straight away. When I stopped for breakfast, you asked me for a hug right away, and I realised it was for you, for whom I had been waiting all these years.


We ate breakfast. I was pleased to present you to all my friends and tell them that I had discovered my girl, with whom I intend to spend the rest of my life. First, I took you to Ballu, any of my friends would be shocked to see a girl with me, and that too with one of my friends' sisters. It's a small heart attack for any of my friends on any given day. Then we went to a café for lunch, and I was constantly staring at you, laughing while telling our tale and living those moments to the fullest.

That evening, I invited Harish to meet you, and we went to Syala Drive-In, where Harish reacted in the same way that Ballu did, I was just holding your hands as we walked through the parking lot, talking about each other and knowing a little more about you. All of those moments seemed amazing, and I wished that beautiful day would never end.

## Marry Me?

This is the thought I had while returning back home; the journey felt entirely different this time, with all the beautiful memories I had with you, knowing you more made me fall even more in love with you and made me realise that you are the only one for me and I am the only one for you.

### **And That's how our beautiful journey started**
