You remember the night before our return from Pangong Lake, when we were camping under the stars and I was telling everyone my stories? You were enjoying everything while you were by my side. I didn't feel anything special about it that day, but having those moments with you today makes it extremely wonderful.

Next, we went to dinner, and you sat in front of me, while I was listening to music on my JBL. You looked at me differently, and I could tell you were thinking about me and chatting to Divya about it, but I never gave it any attention.

The next morning, I was down drifting the bike after an incident that made you cry, and after all of that, we began to make our way back home. David stated that he wants to travel by car due to altitude sickness, and I was thinking at the time that I'll go all out driving like crazy today, I noticed you stepping out of the house and I'm not sure why I wanted you to be my pillion ride that day, I recall hitting you on the back and asking if you wanted to join me, which you did.

### **Everything happened just it was meant to be**
## The Journey:

Then the journey began, and all I could think about was giving you some crazy experience that you would remember me for the rest of your life. I was asking you to stand alongside me on the uneven roads, driving like mad on the ghat areas, I was deep inside wondering if you were terrified of my ride and when I noticed our shadows your hands were widely stretched and dancing on my back. It felt amazing to me to watch you enjoying my company.

I could feel you holding me on the bike whenever we were standing on the bike with those bumps approaching, but I never gave it any attention.

Following the horrific incident in Pangong. Seeing your concern for others and doing everything you could made me realise how beautiful you are at heart, and it felt like you were just like me. Our genuine acts are shown during times of difficulty, and you are always there for your loved ones, and that quality alone distinguishes you from the rest of the world.

In that army camp you remember, your finger became jammed between the doors, despite the fact that I was wearing goggles and listening to my own world through earphones. I felt your pain and, seeing you standing, I pulled a chair for you to sit. I'm not sure why I seemed to care for you but never gave it any attention.

That accident made me realise how I put not only my life but also your life in danger. If something had occurred that day, I don't think I could forgive myself for the rest of my life, and I am grateful you were by my side that day.

At the very least, we made it to the night where you proposed me, and I was in shell shock. From that point on, I began seriously considering us being together. I simply do not take anything for granted, and finding a life partner is far more difficult for everyone. I will be eternally grateful to you for approaching me that day without you, we would not have been together and my life would not have been as perfect as it was.  you are my everything, and all my love will be directed solely toward our family. **LETS BUILD A FOREVER LIKE NO OTHER.**
