      <description>Un-Told Story: You remember the night before our return from Pangong Lake, when we were camping under the stars and I was telling everyone my stories? You were enjoying everything while you were by my side. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel anything special about it that day, but having those moments with you today makes it extremely wonderful.
Next, we went to dinner, and you sat in front of me, while I was listening to music on my JBL.</description>

      <description>I had no idea how this date thing works, and with the image I carry, there was no way for me to contact any friends, then Google came to my rescue. since I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go empty-handed, I quickly went and collected the bunch of roses and already had my Amazon purchase delivered the previous night, all I need is to start my journey at 4 in the morning.</description>
